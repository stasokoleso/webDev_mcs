					<p class="main-text">Benjamin Sainte-Clémentine (/ˈklɛməntaɪn/; born 7 December 1988) is a British artist, poet, vocalist, composer, and musician. Clementine's debut album At Least for Now won the 2015 Mercury Prize. In February 2019 he was named a knight of the Order of Arts and Letters by the French government, in recognition of his contribution to the arts. <br>Born and raised in London, England, Clementine later moved to Paris, France, becoming homeless as a teenager. There, his performances helped him to become a cult figure in the music and art scene. Moving back to London, he made his TV debut on the BBC programme Later With Jools Holland in 2013. A number of critics described him as becoming one of the great singer-songwriters of his generation and the future sound of London, whilst struggling to place his music in any one genre.<br>Considered by The New York Times as one of the 28 geniuses who defined culture in 2016, Clementine's compositions are musically incisive and attuned to the issues of life but also poetic, mixing revolt with love and melancholy, sophisticated lyricism with slang and shouts, and rhyming verse with prose monologues. He moved to popular art music, breaking free from traditional song structure, inventing his own dramatic and innovative musical territory. He is noticeably seen topless and barefoot onstage, dressed entirely in black or dark grey, with a long, wool trench coat.</p>

					<p class="main-text">Before Clementine signed a major deal he closely met and worked with a French tour agent with his independent label in Paris and embarked on a brief European tour playing in high-profile festivals as the Montreux Jazz Festival, the Montreal Jazz Festival in Canada; and Eurosonic Festival, of which Rob Van Der Zwaan writing for podium.info described him as one of the highlights. As a result, the North Sea Jazz Festival in 2013 booked Clementine to play. He failed to attend. According to Clementine, he was kicked off the train en route to Rotterdam for being unable to show a valid ticket. He didn't have enough money due to not getting paid by his then-tour agent. Clementine later stated that he had attempted to travel by foot to Rotterdam, after assuming the city was close by. However, the journey was in fact 45 km, which was considerably longer than he had estimated. He had tried to stop passers by while walking along the motorway, but nobody would stop and help. It took him about 10 hours to complete the journey and he arrived at his destination with bleeding toes. When he set off walking he was wearing slippers, but at some point decided to carry on walking barefoot. Despite this, two years later he was offered another spot at the same festival. In 2014, during the shooting of his music video for "At Least for Now", Clementine fell on a pile of stones in Ireland, badly injuring his elbow, then later cut a toe whilst walking on stones. In March 2015, whilst performing in the middle of a concert in Paris, he cut a finger open and started to bleed, but kept on playing until an audience member threw tissues on the stage. He later cynically remarked: that's what happens when you fall in love; you get hurt.
