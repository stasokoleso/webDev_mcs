				<div class="text">
					Healthy avocado toast is super easy to make and makes the perfect addition to any breakfast or an anytime snack!
					To begin, simply toast your bread; You can use any kind of toast or sliced bread you have but I like to use crusty bread or whole grain toast.  Next, mash an avocado in a small bowl with a fork. Add cilantro, lime, and salt + pepper then spread the mixture on the toasted slice of bread. Sprinkle with pepper flakes and serve!
					<div class="ingredients">Ingredients</div>
					1 avocado peeled and seeded<br>
					2 tablespoons chopped cilantro<br>
					juice of 1/2 lime<br>
					1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes optional<br>
					salt & pepper to taste<br>
					2 slices whole grain bread or bread of choice<br>
					2 eggs fried, scrambled, or poached, optional
